This is my second project, and it fills me with a profound sense of nostalgia. Looking at it now, I can't help but laugh at the mistakes and faults I made. However, I feel great about these small errors because they taught me a lot. I don't want to modify or fix these mistakes; they're a valuable part of my learning journey.
